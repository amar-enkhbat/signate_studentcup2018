## Python Notebook
I did everything on a single Jupyter notebook.
<br>
The notebook contains the both the codes and explanations (comments). However, the competition rule states that competitors are not allowed to post competition data. If you want run it locally got to the competition and download the data.

Special thanks to fellow competitor and subsequent winner of the competition Nadare for his baseline notebook. I couldn't have improved my score without it.
