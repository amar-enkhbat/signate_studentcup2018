## Python Notebook
I did everything on a single Jupyter notebook.
<br>
The notebook contains both codes and explanations (comments). However, the competition rules state that competitors are not allowed to post competition data. If you want run it locally go to the competition website and download the data.

Special thanks to fellow competitor and subsequent winner of the competition Nadare for his baseline notebook. I couldn't have improved my score without it.
